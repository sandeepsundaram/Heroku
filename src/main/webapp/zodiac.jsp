				<p>Lion is considered the ruler of the jungle, so also you are the leader of your own world; you exhibit impeccable bravery, superiority and sovereignty. You are expected to achieve extraordinary feats. You have the strength of character to take command of any situation and your presence commands respect and attention. And just like a king, you have a big heart, you are generous and sensitive to others’ feelings.
But again, you are quite egotistical and it’s quite easy to flatter and take advantage of you. At the same time, you tend to be quite self-congratulatory and boastful and at the same time dominating, courting resentment from your peers. Leo is all about ambition and compassion; and at the same time headstrong and a little corrupted by power. But it equally characteristic of you to be contemplative and moody, especially when you are with yourself.</p>
